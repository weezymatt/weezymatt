### Hiya, I'm Matthew 👋
I'm a computational linguist with experience in machine learning, data management, and language technology. My recent experience includes fine-tuning NLP models for low-resource languages, and constructing novel datasets to support various linguistic phenomenon and evaluate LLMs on them.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning about ontologies & taxonomies, machine translation, and MLOps
- 👨🏽‍💻 I’m currently contributing to open-source software and responding to discussions (helps prevent skills from being rusty!)
- 📖 I'm also translating various code documentation into Spanish
- 📋 Stay healthy🍎, keep running🏃‍♂️, and build some LEGO 🏗️🧱
